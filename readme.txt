== Description ==
This is my first Wordpress plug-in and is intended to mark new or fresh on blog and thus have visitors attention to it. What is fresh post and what is old it depends from blog to blog. Someone make posts every hour, every day and someone every week.
Plug-in provides option to change number of days to consider posts fresh/new. I did not look if there is plug-in that does similar or same thing, i just made this one.

== Installation ==
1. Upload folder `wp-ifp-plugin` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. And this is it. Plugin wil work with default settings loaded
4. Optional you can edit `/wp-content/plugins/wp-ifp-plugin/ifp_settings.ini` for custom plugin settings (time, sign, color and effect)
